# SimplyDMX UI

This is the frontend for SimplyDMX, my stage lighting software written in Rust with a focus on
live control.

The SimplyDMX backend's source code was recently relesased, and this repository has been merged
into it under the `simplydmx_frontend` directory.

The SimplyDMX backend can be found here on GitHub at https://github.com/sploders101/simplydmx
